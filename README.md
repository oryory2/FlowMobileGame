Flow is a puzzle game where players connect matching colored dots to create a flow, covering the entire board to solve each puzzle.

In Flow, players can choose from three distinct game modes: Easy, Medium, and Hard. Each mode sets a specific target for the number of flows players need to connect in order to complete the game.
